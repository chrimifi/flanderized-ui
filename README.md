# Flanderized

# Unfinished - Install at your own risk

Outlander is a dark, flat UI theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/).
Flanderized combines the elegant lines of Outlander with the tranquil-yet-vivid
colorset we call Solarized Dark.

Best used with the Solarized Dark syntax theme that comes included with Atom.

## Installation
Run the following in a terminal:
```sh
$ apm install flanderized-ui
```
Alternatively, the theme can be installed from the settings menu at **_preferences -> themes_**, from where the theme itself can also be applied.

#### What's with the name?
An excellent question. **F**ork of Out**lander** incorporating Sola**rized** = **Flanderized**

It's also a reference to the TV Tropes concept of [Flanderization](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization).
